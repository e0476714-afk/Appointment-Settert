# Copilot Instructions for Appointment-Settert

This repository is for software supporting healthcare providers, focused on appointment setting. The codebase is minimal at present, so update these instructions as the project evolves.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose:** Appointment management for healthcare providers.
- **Architecture:** The current structure is flat, with all files at the root. No subdirectories or major components are present yet.
- **Key File:** `README.md` (contains only a brief description).

## Developer Workflows
- **No build/test scripts or configuration files detected.**
- **No language-specific files or package managers present.**
- **No documented commands for running, building, or testing.**

## Patterns & Conventions
- **No custom conventions or patterns are documented.**
- **No integration points or external dependencies found.**

## Guidance for AI Agents
- If adding new features, consider creating clear subdirectories for components, services, and data models as the project grows.
- Document any new workflows, commands, or conventions in this file and in the `README.md`.
- Reference and update this file as the architecture evolves.

## Example Next Steps
- If implementing appointment logic, create a `src/` directory and place core modules there.
- If introducing dependencies, add a package manager file (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`) and document install/run steps here.

**Update these instructions as the codebase expands.**
